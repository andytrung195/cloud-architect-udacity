Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:
1.Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
According to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZSingleStandby.html:
"If a planned or unplanned outage of your DB instance results from an infrastructure defect, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have turned on Multi-AZ. 
The time that it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. 
Failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds. However, large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time. 
When the failover is complete, it can take additional time for the RDS console to reflect the new Availability Zone"

Because there will be affected by some elements like:transactions numbers, recover process length, thus failover times are typically 60-120s => the minimum RTO for a single multiAZ RDS should be around 60-120s
2.Minimum RTO for a single region outage
If there is failover in a region, the RDS takes time to start up a new instance in different region and apply all backup data, approximately it takes 40 mins to 1h 
3.Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Depend how many data being sent to rds among failover time, but in my opinion it's just a couple of seconds for high traffic service.
4.Minimum RPO for a single region outage
Depend on how frequently backup data of main RDS and how fast the backup data is restored
